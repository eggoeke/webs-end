My name is <b>Eggy Goeke</b> and I'm a passionate <i>coder</i>, a dedicated <i>volunteer</i> at my local <i>radio station</i>, a <i>mentor</i> to a <i>FIRST robotics team</i>, an enthusiastic <i>knitter</i>, and an avid <i>reader</i>. I enjoy exploring the intersection of <i>technology and creativity</i>, whether it's through writing code, crafting cozy knitwear, or getting lost in a good book. My volunteer work allows me to connect with the community and share my love for <i>music, code, and stories</i>.
