In this new chapter, I've moved, started playing music on the radio, and have been reading and writing a lot. From the rain and storms I've weathered, comes a period of growth with all its pain and hope.

I think <b>Jessica Pratt</b> sums up the past few months in her song <b>Greycedes</b>:
<center>
<i>"Turn the pages of a book, 'cause I can't even look<br>
At the words there, tell me what they say<br>
I can't even try to read the words sometimes"</i>
</center>

I recently started writing a book, to which my mom said <i>"It's personal. Are you sure you want this out there?"</i> It wasn't even a book about me, I just don't think I know how to not make it personal. I'm not even sure if it's a fault or a virtue-- it's more like it just <b><i>is</i></b>.

It feels like I’ve been to <b>hell</b> and back, as I’ve swerved across life’s interstate, trying to get from one period of my life to the next. I've come to terms that I am no longer a <i>gifted kid</i>, and instead, I am holding out to become a <i>late-blooming adult</i>. When I was young, my main problems in life were physics-related. Now, I keep in constant contact with people wiser than me, so I don’t become tangled up in the complexity and intricate patterns that muddle me.

<h3><b>What does this all mean?</b></h3>

It means I've gone through several difficult-to-navigate transitions this year. But, I won't bore you with that. Instead, I'm going to discuss the <b>good stuff</b>, both already done and planned.

<h2><b>Beaver Island</b></h2>
I've moved across the country to <b>Beaver Island</b>, a small island in Lake Michigan. I've been here for about a month now, and I have to say <b>it is a healing place</b>. I have met so many wonderful people from all walks of life.

<h2><b>WVBI</b></h2>
I've started playing music on the radio. I do <b>Top 10 Plus 5</b> on <b> WVBI</b>, <i>The Voice of Beaver Island</i>, so you're likely to hear me if you tune into 100.1 FM on Beaver Island on Wednesdays at <i>7:00 PM EST</i> or Saturdays at <i>10:00 AM EST</i>. Here's my North Carolina-themed playlist from this upcoming week:

  <div class="custom-audio-player">
    <audio id="audio-player" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audio/carolinattpf.wav"></audio>
    <div class="controls">
      <button id="play-pause" class="control-button"><i class="fas fa-play"></i></button>
      <input type="range" id="seek-bar" value="0">
      <span id="current-time">0:00</span> / <span id="duration">0:00</span>
      <button id="mute-toggle" class="control-button"><i class="fas fa-volume-up"></i></button>
      <input type="range" id="volume-bar" value="1" max="1" step="0.01">

<h2><b>Reading and Creative Writing</b></h2>
I've been writing a lot of creative pieces lately. I've been working on a book, but I've also been writing short stories and poetry. It's cathartic to select words and put them into sentences like stringing beads into strands, and strands into jewelry. The process of seeing parts combining to become something greater than their sum gives me hope.

I've also been reading a lot lately. Right now, I'm reading <b>All the Pretty Horses</b> by <b>Cormac McCarthy</b>, which has already broken my heart in a few places. McCarthy's writing takes a bit of getting used to (the man does not use quotations), but the brevity and devastation of his prose perfectly match the subject matter.

<h2><b>Web's End</b></h2>
I've been working as an AI data trainer for a little bit now. The position is great, and I get to make little projects for the AI to code for me. <b>Web's End</b> is one of those projects. I want to use this blog as an outlet for all my little works.

<h3><b>In Conclusion</b></h3>
I'm excited to see where this new chapter takes me. I hope you'll stick around to see it too. Stay tuned for next week's Top 10 Plus 5 on WVBI, which is about <i>storms</i>, some rants about <i>letting go</i>, and a few other surprises.
<b>Until then, take care</b>.
